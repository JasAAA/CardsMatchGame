# CardsMatchGame

## Overview

The Memory Card Game is a classic matching game where players try to find pairs of matching cards. The game is played on a grid of cards that are face down. Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time to reveal their faces. If the two cards match, they remain face up; if they don't, they are flipped back face down. The game continues until all pairs have been matched.

## Features

- A grid-based layout with 4 rows and 5 columns of cards.
- Each card has a matching pair.
- The cards are shuffled randomly at the start of the game.
- The number of wrong flips is tracked and displayed.
- Cards are hidden initially and revealed after a short delay.
